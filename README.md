# Code Wars Solutions

## Overview
The purpose of this repo is to track my Code Wars solutions throughout DeltaV 301. Code Wars challenges are assigned for us to practice the skills we are learning in class.

## Task
We are asked to solve one problem each day with a new partner before midnight. We have from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. to whiteboard our psuedocode solution. Pseudocode means writing out a plan in human-readable form. At this time we are not writing any actual code, only referencing Code Wars for the problem domain.

After taking a picture of our whiteboard, we add it to our personal repo. I organized each day&apos;s challenge in separate numbered folders (starting with &quot;01-&quot;). We then move on to write the solution on Code Wars. When all of the tests pass and turn green I add the solution to my repo.

To practice good workflow I work on a new branch for each challenge. For example, for the first day&apos;s challenge I made a new branch with the command &quot;git checkout -b abbreviate-a-two-word-name&quot;. When I finish the assignment each day I make a new pull request from the daily challenge branch to my master branch and submit the URL in Canvas for grading.
