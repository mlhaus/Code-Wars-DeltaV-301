### Overview of the process for solving the challenge

1.  [Craig](https://github.com/tektechnologies 'Craig') and I wrote pseudocode on our [whiteboard](whiteboard.jpg 'whiteboard').
2.  We created an empty string.
3.  We wrote a for loop that iterated over each letter in the string.

- We concatenated each letter one at a time to the beginning of the empty string.

4.  We returned the resulting string which represents the same word in reverse.
