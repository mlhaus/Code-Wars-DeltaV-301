### Description of the problem domain

Make the double() function return a new array with each value twice as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array. Your solution must use the map() function of the built-in javascript Array object. If you're not familiar with map(), reading over the documentation may help.

```
function double(array) {
    // Use array.map() to return a new array with each value twice
    // as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array.
}
```

#### Example

double([1,2,10,57]) ==> [2,4,20,114]

### Overview of the process for solving the challenge

1.  [Nathan](https://github.com/cashmann 'Nathan') and I planned our [whiteboard](whiteboard.jpg 'whiteboard').
2.  We learned about using the [array map function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) to take each value in an array and perform a calculation on it. In this case we take each value and multiply it by 2.
